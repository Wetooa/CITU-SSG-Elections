# 🗳️ **PROJECT E - Cebu Institute of Technology University SSG Elections Website** 🗳️

**2025 - Confidential**

## 📜 **Description**

**PROJECT E** is an interactive and informative website designed for the **Cebu Institute of Technology University**'s **SSG (Student Government)** Elections. The platform allows students to learn about candidates, their platforms, achievements, and other relevant details. It also features a countdown timer to voting day, a live voting tally, and an engaging comparison tool to help voters make informed decisions. With a clean, user-friendly interface, PROJECT E ensures transparency and accessibility for all students participating in the election process.

## 🔧 **Tech Stack**

For the development of the SSG Elections 2025 platform, our team utilized a modern and efficient web development stack, informally referred to in the developer community as the “**SHIT** stack”—an acronym representing:

- **S** – **Supabase** (Backend)
- **H** – **Hosting** (Vercel)
- **I** – **Interface** (Next.js)
- **T** – **TypeScript/TailwindCSS** (Frontend)

This combination was carefully selected to meet the project's requirements for speed, scalability, and maintainability.

- **Supabase** was employed as the backend solution, providing real-time database capabilities, authentication, and API support.
- **Vercel** was chosen for its reliable and globally distributed hosting infrastructure, enabling seamless deployment and continuous integration.
- The user interface was developed using **Next.js**, a robust React framework known for its performance and server-side rendering features.
- **TypeScript** was adopted for type safety and code reliability, while **TailwindCSS** was used to ensure a consistent and responsive design system.

Together, this stack provided a strong foundation for building a secure, user-centric, and future-ready election system.

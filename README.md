# 🗳️ **PROJECT E - Cebu Institute of Technology University SSG Elections Website** 🗳️

## 📜 **Description**

**PROJECT E** is an interactive and informative website designed for the **Cebu Institute of Technology University**'s **SSG (Student Government)** Elections. The platform allows students to learn about candidates, their platforms, achievements, and other relevant details. It also features a countdown timer to voting day, a live voting tally, and an engaging comparison tool to help voters make informed decisions. With a clean, user-friendly interface, PROJECT E ensures transparency and accessibility for all students participating in the election process.

## 🔧 **Tech Stack**

To bring the SSG Elections 2025 platform to life, our team proudly built on the **NeNeng B Stack**—a lighthearted but powerful blend of modern web technologies. **NeNeng B** stands for:

- **Ne** – **Next.js** (Frontend)
- **Ne** – **NestJS** (Backend)
- **N** – **Node.js** (Under the hood of both)
- **E** – **Edge Hosting** via **Vercel**
- **N** – **Neat UI** with **TailwindCSS**
- **G** – **Generics and Type Safety** with **TypeScript**
- **B** – **Backend-as-a-Service** with **Supabase**

This stack gave us everything we needed to develop a robust, scalable, and secure platform, while keeping our codebase clean, our deployment seamless, and our UI beautifully responsive. Just like its name, the **NeNeng B Stack** is unexpectedly powerful, full of charm, and built to deliver results.

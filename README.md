**2025 - Confidential**

## 📜 **Description**

## 🔧 **Tech Stack**

<<<<<<< HEAD
For the development of the SSG Elections 2025 platform, our team utilized a modern and efficient web development stack, informally referred to in the developer community as the “**NeNeng B** stack”—an acronym representing:

- **Ne** – **Next.js** (Frontend)
- **Ne** – **NestJS** (Backend)
- **N** - **Node.js**
- **E** - **Edge Hosting via Vercel**
- **N** - **Neat UI with TailwindCSS**
- **G** – **Generics and Type Safety with TypeScript**
- **B** – **Backend-as-a-Service with Supabase**
=======
To bring the SSG Elections 2025 platform to life, our team proudly built on the **NeNeng B Stack**—a lighthearted but powerful blend of modern web technologies. **NeNeng B** stands for:

- **Ne** – **Next.js** (Frontend)
- **Ne** – **NestJS** (Backend)
- **N** – **Node.js** (Under the hood of both)
- **E** – **Edge Hosting** via **Vercel**
- **N** – **Neat UI** with **TailwindCSS**
- **G** – **Generics and Type Safety** with **TypeScript**
- **B** – **Backend-as-a-Service** with **Supabase**

This stack gave us everything we needed to develop a robust, scalable, and secure platform, while keeping our codebase clean, our deployment seamless, and our UI beautifully responsive. Just like its name, the **NeNeng B Stack** is unexpectedly powerful, full of charm, and built to deliver results.
